{"text": "\u201cExtraordinary.\u201d \u201cStellar.\u201d \u201cTruly awesome.\u201d \u201cA world-class find.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how paleontologists are reacting to the discovery of several hundred ridiculously well-preserved pterosaur eggs in China, some of them still containing the remains of embryos.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was extreme jealousy,\u201d said David Unwin, a pterosaur expert and paleobiologist at the University of Leicester. \u201cReally.\u201d\n\nTo understand why Unwin and others are freaking out about the discovery, published Thursday in the journal Science, you have to first appreciate how rare pterosaur eggs are.\n\nThe pterosaurs were an order of flying reptiles that went extinct some 66 million years ago. They were not actually dinosaurs, but they went extinct at the same time. Along with bats and birds, they are the only vertebrates to truly fly. And though these creatures lorded over the skies for around 162 million years, only a handful of pterosaur egg fossils have ever been unearthed. And of those, paleontologists have just six three-dimensional eggs \u2013 that is, eggs not completely flattened by millions of years of being crushed under younger sediments.\n\nBut now, we have a pterosaur egg extravaganza. According to the new research, a site in China\u2019s Turpan-Hami Basin in Xinjiang has coughed up 215 beautiful, pliable and miraculously three-dimensional eggs \u2013 16 of which contain embryonic remains. The researchers also suspect there could be as many as 300 more eggs within the same sandstone block. No wonder Xiaolin Wang, the study\u2019s lead author and a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the discovery could be described as a sort of \u201cpterosaur Eden.\u201d\n\nAside from breaking records, Unwin said there are practical reasons for why having more eggs is better. \u201cWhen you have a really unique find, you basically can\u2019t do anything to it because that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got.\u201d But now that we have literally hundreds of eggs to work with, we have more options \u2013 such as cutting different eggs into cross-sections to study growth rates.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the egg treasure trove also boasts skeletons from what appear to be hatchlings, juveniles and adults. This, too, is an embarrassment of riches because it means scientists now have more information about how pterosaurs progressed from egg to adult than ever before.\n\n\u201cThis is by far the most exciting discovery that I know of,\u201d said Alexander Kellner, co-author of the new study and paleontologist at the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.\n\nAnd Kellner isn\u2019t some newbie to pterosaur discoveries. He\u2019s been studying these ancient animals for more than 30 years and has personally been a part of naming or describing more than 20 species. This includes the species in question, Hamipterus tianshanensis, which Kellner, Wang and a team of their colleagues discovered in 2014.\n\nWith a wingspan of approximately 11 feet, an adult H. tianshanensis may have been something like an albatross. You know, if albatrosses had large crests running the lengths of their heads and spikelike teeth. This species does not appear to have had feathers, Kellner said.\n\nProbably a fish-eater, H. tianshanensis inhabited hot and dry environments but would have buried its eggs in the sand and vegetation found on the shores of lakes or rivers. This is also likely why so many eggs have been found together. Kellner suspects recent storms caused torrential flooding which unearthed the eggs and washed them into the fossil record, along with other, older pterosaurs that fell victim to the deluge.\n\nWhile all four of the outside researchers contacted for this story seemed genuinely wowed by the team\u2019s findings, they did not agree with all of the conclusions the study\u2019s authors drew from the fossils.\n\nThe paper says that H. tianshanensis hatchlings wouldn\u2019t have been able to fly immediately because several of the eggs the team examined showed wing bones that were less developed than expected. This may have meant that baby pterosaurs would have spent some time on the ground hunting insects and generally trying not to be eaten before learning how to take wing. Kellner even speculated that the pterosaur females and maybe even males would have stuck around to feed the hatchlings to help get them through such a precarious stage.\n\nMy first thought was extreme jealousy. Really\n\nMichael Habib, a paleontologist at the University of Southern California, said the authors make a good argument but that it doesn\u2019t necessarily prove the young pterosaurs were flightless.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that while the wings were less mature than the bones of the thighs in some respects, the wing bones are still much more robust than the bones of the hind limbs,\u201d Habib said.\n\nFurthermore, he said, bone shape and structure are integral to strength, which means it\u2019s possible for a comparatively underdeveloped bone to in fact be stronger than one that is seemingly more developed.\n\nUnwin is similarly unconvinced that the hatchlings were grounded. For starters, he said, the embryos in question were likely only halfway done growing, so they would have developed more before they hatched out. Furthermore, none of these embryos have their teeth yet, and if pterosaurs are similar to other reptile groups in development \u2013 as most experts agree they are \u2013 then lack of teeth is a pretty good indicator that they weren\u2019t fully baked, so to speak.\n\nUnwin said this makes the find even more important because all of the pterosaur embryos that have been discovered thus far have been late-stage and nearly ready to hatch.\n\n\u201cAnd while it\u2019s wonderful to have those, they\u2019re not much different from hatchlings really,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think these new embryonic finds are really exciting because with these, we can begin to reconstruct the embryonic development of pterosaurs inside the egg. I just think it\u2019ll take time to do that.\u201d\n\nHundreds of pterosaur eggs in one place is impressive, but Unwin said we\u2019d need more evidence to demonstrate another suggestion in the paper: that this species of pterosaur was a communal nester, like penguins. Instead, Unwin thinks it more likely that a bunch of female pterosaurs simply laid their eggs in the same general area, much like female sea turtles returning to the same beaches year after year.\n\nLuis Chiappe, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, said this paper is probably just the tip of the iceberg and that a site like this could sustain a decade or more of research.\n\n\u201cPterosaurs are incredibly diverse, not just in the shape but also in sizes,\u201d said Chiappe, who was part of a team that described a 100-million-year-old pterosaur egg in central Argentina in 2004.\n\nPterosaurs ran the gamut from the gigantic, aircraftlike Quetzalcoatlus all the way down to animals about the size of a sparrow, such as Nemicolopterus. Some had the long, pointy snouts we typically associate with the flying reptiles. Others boasted wild and crazy crests, which may have been used to attract the opposite sex, as has been suggested with H. tianshanensis. And still other pterosaur species had short, squat skulls more like that of a frog, Chiappe said. (Albeit, a very scary frog.)\n\nPterosaurs were the very first animals with backbones to master powered flight, Kellner said. How they did what they did, and did it for as long as they did, is just one of the mysteries he and his colleagues hope to solve.", "title": "Paleontologists discover the mother lode \u2014 215 miraculously well-preserved pterosaur eggs", "url": "http://nationalpost.com/news/world/paleontologists-discover-the-mother-lode-215-miraculously-well-preserved-pterosaur-eggs"}
