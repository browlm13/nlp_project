{"title": "Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Cambridge papers added to UNESCO\u2019s Memory of the World Register", "text": "Held at Cambridge University Library, Newton\u2019s scientific and mathematical papers represent one of the most important archives of scientific and intellectual work on universal phenomena. They document the development of his thought on gravity, calculus and optics, and reveal ideas worked out through painstaking experiments, calculations, correspondence and revisions.\n\nIn combination with alchemical papers at King\u2019s College, Cambridge and his notebooks and correspondence at Trinity College, Cambridge and the Fitzwilliam Museum, this represents the largest and most important collection of Newton\u2019s papers worldwide.\n\nKatrina Dean, Curator of Scientific Collections at Cambridge University Library said: \u201cNewton\u2019s papers are among the world\u2019s most important collections in the western scientific tradition and are one of the Library\u2019s most treasured collections. They were the first items to be digitised and added to the Cambridge Digital Library in 2011 and featured in our 600th anniversary exhibition Lines of Thought last year. In 2017, their addition to the UNESCO International Memory of the World Register recognises their unquestionable international importance.\u201d\n\nThe Memory of the World Project is an international initiative to safeguard the documentary heritage of humanity against collective amnesia, neglect, the ravages of time and climatic conditions, and wilful and deliberate destruction. It calls for the preservation of valuable archival, library and private collections all over the world, as well as the reconstitution of dispersed or displaced documentary heritage, and the increased accessibility to and dissemination of these items.\n\nNewton\u2019s Cambridge papers, and those at the Royal Society, now join the archive of Winston Churchill, held at Cambridge University\u2019s Churchill Archives Centre, on the UNESCO Register. They also join Newton\u2019s theological and alchemical papers at the National Library of Israel, which were added in 2015.\n\nThe chief attractions in the Cambridge collection are Newton\u2019s own copies of the first edition of the Principia (1687), covered with his corrections, revisions and additions for the second edition.\n\nImage from Newton\u2019s essay \u2018Of Colours\u2019 which includes the above diagram to illustrate the experiment in which he inserted a bodkin into his eye socket to put pressure on the eyeball to try to replicate the sensation of colour in normal sight.

His essay \u2018Of Colours\u2019 includes a diagram that illustrates the experiment in which he inserted a bodkin into his eye socket to put pressure on the eyeball to try to replicate the sensation of colour in normal sight.\u201d\n\nAnother important item is Newton\u2019s so-called \u2018Waste Book\u2019, a large notebook inherited from his stepfather. From 1664, he used the blank pages for optical and mathematical calculations and gradually mastered the analysis of curved lines, surfaces and solids. By 1665, he had invented the method of calculus. Newton later used the dated, documentary evidence provided by the Waste Book to argue his case in the priority dispute with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over the invention of the calculus.\n\nCambridge University Librarian Jess Gardner said: \u201cNewton\u2019s work and life continue to attract wonder and new perspectives on our place in the Universe. Cambridge University Library will continue to work with scholars and curators worldwide to make Newton\u2019s papers accessible now and for future generations.\u201d\n\nIsaac Newton entered Trinity College as an undergraduate in 1661 and became a Fellow in 1667. In 1669, he became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, a position he held until 1701.\n\nAmong the more personal items in the Cambridge collections are Newton\u2019s daily concerns as recorded in an undergraduate notebook which records Newton\u2019s expenditure on white wine, wafers, shoe-strings and \u2018a paire of stockings\u2019, along with a guide to Latin pronunciation.\n\nA notebook of 1662-1669 records Newton\u2019s sins before and after Whitsunday of 1662, written in a coded shorthand and first deciphered between 1872 and 1888. Among them are \u2018Eating an apple at Thy house\u2019, \u2018Robbing my mothers box of plums and sugar\u2019 along with the more serious \u2018Wishing death and hoping it to some\u2019 before a list of his expenses. These included chemicals, two furnaces and a recent edition of one of the most comprehensive compilations of alchemical writings in the western tradition Theatrum chemicum, edited by the publisher Lazarus Zetzner.\n\nCambridge University Library is also hosting a series of talks open to the public by Sarah Dry and Patricia Fara on Newton\u2019s manuscripts and Newton\u2019s role in Enlightenment culture and polite society on December 7 and December 14 respectively.
