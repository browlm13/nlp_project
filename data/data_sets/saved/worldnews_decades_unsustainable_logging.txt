{"text": "Modelling says there is a 92% chance mountain ash forests will not be able to support current ecosystem by 2067\n\nDecades of unsustainable logging has created an \u201cextinction debt\u201d in Victoria\u2019s central highlands that will trigger an ecosystem-wide collapse within 50 years without urgent intervention from the state government, ecologists have warned.\n\nAccording to modelling produced by Australian National University researchers Dr Emma Burns and Prof David Lindenmayer, there is a 92% chance the mountain ash forests will not be able to support its current ecosystem of arboreal animals, like the critically endangered leadbeater\u2019s possum, by 2067.\n\nIf current logging practices continue, or if the forests experience another Black Saturday level bushfire, the likelihood of collapse approaches 100%.\n\n\u201cAnything in the next 50 years that requires a tree old enough to bear a hollow is in trouble,\u201d Burns said.\n\nConservationists call for moratorium on logging to save endangered Leadbeater\u2019s possum Read more\n\nThe modelling, published in Austral Ecology, has been before the Andrews government for two years but is yet to receive a formal response. The expert panel tasked with resolving the future of the central highlands declared itself unable to come to agreement and disbanded in February.\n\nGuardian Australia understands it is one of the top three issues the premier, Daniel Andrews, wants resolved before the 2018 state election. If unresolved Labor stands to lose votes from both sides, with the Greens pushing for the area to be protected under a new great forests national park and the Liberal and National parties calling for more areas to be opened up to logging.\n\nBurns said the problem is the product of historical logging practices and that no amount of future logging is compatible with the ecosystem\u2019s survival.\n\n\u201cUnsustainable practices in the past is what\u2019s causing problems for the current logging industry, which is now much more sustainable, but they have got this extinction debt,\u201d Burns told Guardian Australia. \u201cMy opinion is there is nothing they can do sustainably to harvest that 52,000ha area of concern.\u201d\n\nBurns presented the modelling at a joint conference of the Australian and New Zealand ecological societies in the Hunter Valley on Thursday. She said it had the potential to become a significant election issue.\n\nThe modelling was undertaken as part of an IUCN assessment and saw the ecosystem listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list.\n\nIt was also relied upon by the commonwealth threatened species scientific advisory committee to increase the listing of the leadbeater\u2019s possum from endangered to critically endangered.\n\nThat decision has been challenged by the forestry industry and is due to be reviewed by the committee, which has provided survey data showing an increase in known leadbeater\u2019s possum populations and called for the species to be downlisted to endangered or lower.\n\nIn March, the then Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, called for the possum to be taken off the endangered list to boost logging and support rural communities.\n\nBarnaby Joyce wants Australia's Leadbeater's possum off endangered list to boost logging Read more\n\nThe committee is due to review that application next month, with the minister expected to announce his decision by March.\n\nConservationists have said the survey data was evidence of increased monitoring but not an increase in population.\n\nShe has called for a combination of widespread forest protections and direct interventions, such as placing nesting boxes.\n\n\u201cIf we were really interested in protecting the diversity of that system we would be really interested in protecting 1939 regrowth, which is not what we do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe protect the old trees with the hollows but we need to be protecting the regrowth that\u2019s coming on stream. It\u2019s like we\u2019re protecting the grandparents but the middle population that you would need to replace yourself is being wiped out.\u201d\n\nMountain ash trees that grew following the 1939 Black Friday bushfires are not yet old enough to bear hollows but are the right age to be logged.\n\n\u201cWe should protect 1939 regrowth,\u201d Burns said. \u201cThe implications of that is that it wouldn\u2019t be a viable logging industry, economically \u2026 that has implications and needs to be thought through very carefully because that is people\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d", "title": "Decades of unsustainable logging has created an \u201cextinction debt\u201d in Victoria\u2019s central highlands that will trigger an ecosystem-wide collapse within 50 years without urgent intervention from the state government in Australia", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/01/victorian-logging-could-trigger-ecosystem-collapse-researchers-say"}
