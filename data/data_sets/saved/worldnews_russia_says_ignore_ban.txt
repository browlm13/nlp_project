That is the sum total of what happened during a week of discussion on the issue of weapons and vehicles operated by artificial intelligence in Geneva.\n\nAccording to a report by DefenseOne.com, a statement by the Russian government on Nov. 10 laid out a very hard-line position against the ban on what the United Nations is calling \u201clethal autonomous weapon systems,\u201d or LAWS.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Russian Federation, the lack of working samples of such weapons systems remains the main problem in the discussion on LAWS,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there are precedents of reaching international agreements that establish a preventive ban on prospective types of weapons. However, this can hardly be considered as an argument for taking preventive prohibitive or restrictive measures against LAWS being a by far more complex and wide class of weapons of which the current understanding of humankind is rather approximate.\u201d\n\nThe Russians also claimed that there was a risk of harming civilian artificial intelligence capabilities, saying, \u201cIt is hardly acceptable for the work on LAWS to restrict the freedom to enjoy the benefits of autonomous technologies being the future of humankind.\u201d\n\nThe Russian hard line comes as questions percolate about Russian compliance with other arms control treaties. Russia has already been accused of violating the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, prompting the United States to begin development of a new ground-launched cruise missile.\n\nA report from RealClearDefense.com noted that Russia\u2019s force of Tu-22M3 Backfire bombers may have been modified in a manner that fits the definition of strategic bombers under the New START Treaty.\n\nIn the past, some arms control treaties have not prevented bad guys from using banned weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention did not prevent the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria from using mustard agent against American troops in 2016.", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-will-ignore-un-killer-robot-ban-2017-11"}
