{"text": "by Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) Media Committee\n\nIn early September, a prisoner in New York\u2019s Sullivan Correctional Facility was given a glass-laced pastry by a correctional officer in what he describes as an attempt to murder him. Dr. Al-Fatah Stewart, a doctor of divinity and metaphysics, has suffered psychological and physical torture throughout his 19-year incarceration, and this is just the latest outrage. He says:\n\n\u201cDepartment of Correctional Services employees at Sullivan Correctional Facility raided my cell [and] destroyed my legal work \u2026 I filed grievances and complaints over this and, in retaliation, these DOCCS employees framed me with a weapon and placed me in solitary \u2026\n\n\u201cWhile in solitary, DOCCS staff placed rocks in my food and so I refused to eat, then was placed in the infirmary after not eating for over two weeks. While in the infirmary, in an isolation cell, a DOCCS employee gave me a warm pastry laced with glass in an effort to kill me and end my litigation against staff at Sullivan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile in solitary, DOCCS staff placed rocks in my food and so I refused to eat, then was placed in the infirmary after not eating for over two weeks. While in the infirmary, in an isolation cell, a DOCCS employee gave me a warm pastry laced with glass in an effort to kill me and end my litigation against staff at Sullivan.\u201d\n\nDr. Stewart sent samples of the pastry to the FBI, the New York State Commission of Correction, the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) and, in desperation at their inaction, directly to Microtrace Labs in Elgin, Illinois, to have it analyzed at his own expense. In a note to the Bay View, he explains that after the OSI \u201cwrote this off as unsubstantiated and closed the case, my union, Industrial Workers of the Worrld, placed a GoFundMe.com ad on the web to pay for this food to be tested \u2013 and the results prove I\u2019m in danger.\u201d\n\nMicrotrace\u2018s investigation (click here to open the full report: Microtrace lab report on glass fragments in pastry sample from Al-Fatah Stewart) found over 100 particles of soda-lime glass, concluding that it was likely added subsequent to baking.\n\nThis finding by a certified laboratory should be a wake-up call about the abuse and secrecy surrounding Sullivan. Dr. Stewart reports that \u201cthere have been a lot of mysterious deaths at Sullivan, but the families of the deceased can\u2019t afford autopsies to prove the actual case of death \u2026 there are a lot of grievances about staff placing glass in prisoners\u2019 food but nothing is ever done.\u201d\n\nDr. Stewart reports that \u201cthere have been a lot of mysterious deaths at Sullivan, but the families of the deceased can\u2019t afford autopsies to prove the actual case of death \u2026 there are a lot of grievances about staff placing glass in prisoners\u2019 food but nothing is ever done.\u201d\n\nAs part of his state court proceedings, Dr. Stewart has now been transferred to Clinton Correctional Facility for his safety. But with Clinton the site of the infamous 2010 murder of inmate Leonard Strickland and subject of countless reports of racism and violence by corrections officers, he remains in serious danger.\n\n\u201cA judge had me moved from Sullivan because of this,\u201d Dr. Stewart writes the Bay View, \u201cand now I\u2019m in the most violent, racist prison in New York state. Please help me.\u201d\n\nThe Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, The Hampton Institute and It\u2019s Going Down stand with Dr. Stewart in his call for a full investigation into the abuse that he and others have suffered at Sullivan, an immediate transfer out of the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision system to prevent further attempts on his life, and a wide-ranging probe into corruption and cover-ups in DOCCS.\n\nIncarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) is a prisoner-led section of the Industrial Workers of the World, struggling to end prison slavery along with allies and supporters on the outside.
