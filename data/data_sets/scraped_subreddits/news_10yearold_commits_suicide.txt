Her mother claims her daughter was confronting a bully.They say it was her first fight and it was recorded by another student and posted on an app called Musical.ly.The video is difficult to watch, but Ashawnty's parents are sharing it to help other parents.The Cherry Creek School District was made aware of the video in October and told KDVR , \"We are looking into this matter and will take appropriate action to ensure the safety of all students involved.\"A district spokesperson clarified on Thursday that they spoke to the children involved, called their parents and handed the video over to Aurora Police.Ashawnty's parents believe that action wasn't enough.\"There was nothing done about it. When I got the call telling me that my daughter had been in a fight, they never gave me the opportunity to meet with the other parents to come to the bottom of the line,\" her mother Latoshia Harris said.\"We got denied that, just to meet with the parent at the school with the staff,\" her father Anthony Davis said.Cherry Creek Schools responded to the allegation by saying, \"The school says they are not aware of such a request.\"The couple believe that if a meeting had occurred, it could have saved their daughter's life.\"I could have taken her out of the school.

She spent two weeks on life support at Children's Hospital Colorado, where she died Wednesday morning.

Mental health support will be made available for any students who need help processing the loss.We do not tolerate bullying of any kind in our schools and we have a comprehensive bullying prevention program in place at all of our schools.
