{"text": "Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has asked the FBI to take over the investigation into the death of Detective Sean Suiter.\n\nDavis made the request in a letter submitted Friday to FBI Director Christopher Wray in Washington. An FBI spokesman had no comment on whether the agency would agree to the request.\n\nDavis announced his decision at a news conference Friday, saying it was prompted in part by a lack of information about a federal police corruption probe in which Suiter was scheduled to testify the day after he was shot. Davis has said Baltimore police weren\u2019t told of Suiter\u2019s pending testimony for nearly a week after his death. He said Friday he fears his detectives are in the dark.\n\n\u201cOur homicide detectives, some of the best in the business, some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen, can\u2019t do their jobs effectively if there is a perception or a reality that we don\u2019t possess all the information that we need to conduct the investigation,\u201d Davis said.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Stephen Schenning on Friday afternoon disputed Davis\u2019 account, saying he told the police commissioner the day Suiter died of the pending testimony. Davis is \u201cmistaken about the timing,\u201d Schenning said.\n\nDavis said late Friday that he was informed of Suiter's pending testimony the day Suiter died \u2014 the day after he'd been shot. Davis said his previous comments about when he had been informed about the testimony had been misinterpreted.\n\nTwo City Council members on Thursday had urged Davis to ask the FBI to take over the investigation to assure the public it would be objective, reasoning Davis agreed with Friday.\n\n\u201cThe community needs to know that I am willing, and this police department is willing, to invite any extra sets of eyes or resources \u2026 to look at this incident to try to figure it out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe decision comes amid a divide among Baltimore police officials over the cause of Suiter\u2019s death, with some investigators believing he was killed and others believing he could have committed suicide.\n\nSuiter, a homicide detective, was fatally shot in the head Nov. 15 during what Davis has described repeatedly in recent weeks as a violent struggle with an unknown suspect on a troubled block in West Baltimore.\n\nDavis said Friday that investigators also have looked into the possibility Suiter committed suicide, but have found no evidence supporting that theory. \u201cThere is no evidence whatsoever right now that leads us to suspect that,\u201d Davis said. But he also said police have not recovered any DNA or other forensic evidence to prove Suiter was shot by another person.\n\nInside the Police Department, officials are divided about where the evidence points. While some share the commissioner\u2019s view that the case appears to be a homicide, some lean toward suicide as the most likely explanation, sources have told The Baltimore Sun.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have could mean a lot of different things,\u201d one source knowledgeable about the investigation said. \u201cThere's no particular evidence that would indicate murder, accident, or suicide.\u201d\n\nMaryland\u2019s chief medical examiner, Dr. David Fowler, said his office ruled Suiter\u2019s death a homicide last week but has been continuing to gather information and review evidence. He said his office has been meeting with investigators regularly, and \u201cpeople have come to us with alternative stories since day one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf any other evidence comes up that we need to amend, we will do so,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cFrom day one, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the medical examiner was very comfortable calling it a homicide.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s \u201cnothing we see that would indicate anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can always amend if we have to.\u201d\n\nCity Council President Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young and Councilman Brandon Scott, chair of the public safety committee, had called on police to turn the investigation into Suiter\u2019s death over to the FBI.\n\nOn Friday, Young and Scott said they were pleased Davis had made the request.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing we should have done all along. It gives the homicide detectives a chance to do what they need to do: mourn and heal and deal with the trauma.\u201d\n\nMayor Catherine Pugh had criticized the councilmen Thursday, but said Friday she firmly supported Davis\u2019 decision. She said she and Davis have both wanted greater FBI involvement in the investigation but wanted to wait to consult with Suiter\u2019s family after his funeral had taken place.\n\nFive Democratic members of Maryland\u2019s congressional delegation who represent Baltimore \u2014 Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, and Reps. Elijah Cummings, Dutch Ruppersberger and John Sarbanes \u2014 also issued a joint statement Friday backing Davis\u2019 request that the FBI take the lead in the investigation.\n\nDavis said he discussed his decision with Suiter\u2019s widow, Nicole, and his family, and that they seemed to understand it.\n\nSuiter was on duty at the time he was shot, investigating a triple killing in the neighborhood that happened last year. There have been no arrests in the case, despite a $215,000 reward for information leading to one.\n\nDavis disclosed last week that Suiter had been scheduled to testify the day after he was killed before a federal grand jury in a police corruption case involving Sgt. Wayne Jenkins \u2014 one of eight members of the department\u2019s Gun Trace Task Force who have been indicted on federal racketeering charges.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances surrounding Detective Suiter\u2019s killing are significantly complicated by the fact that he was to appear before a federal grand jury the following day,\u201d Davis wrote in his letter to the FBI director. \u201cI am growing increasingly uncomfortable that my homicide detectives do not know all of the facts known to the FBI or [U.S. attorney\u2019s office] that could, if revealed to us, assist in furthering this murder investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI respectfully request the FBI to investigate the murder of Detective Suiter,\u201d Davis wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, federal prosecutors filed a new indictment against Jenkins, alleging he duped Suiter seven years ago into finding drugs that Jenkins had planted in a man\u2019s car.\n\nJenkins, who is incarcerated pending trial, has not entered pleas in the cases against him. Several other members of the Gun Trace Task Force have pleaded guilty.\n\nDavis on Friday said he had suspended another officer involved in the 2010 case, who is identified in court records from the original arrest as then-Detective Ryan Guinn. Guinn has declined to comment on the case.\n\nPolice have maintained that Suiter\u2019s intended testimony was not related to his shooting. Davis said Friday that FBI and federal prosecutors have told him they also believe there is no connection. Still, the timing has led to swirling speculation around the case.", "title": "Baltimore police chief requests FBI take over investigation into killing of detective who was set to testify in police corruption case", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-suiter-police-update-20171201-story.html"}
