The retired Army lieutenant-general is unlikely to serve more than six months in prison.\n\nThe White House issued a statement saying that \"nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn\". A presidential appearance in front of reporters was then cancelled.\n\nAs he was escorted from court by FBI agents, a handful of protesters shouted \"criminal\" and \"lock him up\", echoing a chant he led against Hillary Clinton during the Republican party convention last year.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nMr Flynn was forced to resign 23 days into his job in February, a month after he was questioned by the FBI for misleading the White House about meeting then Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the transition period, before Mr Trump took office.\n\nThen, just over a week ago, US media said his legal team had told the president's lawyers they could no longer discuss the case, prompting suggestions that he had begun co-operating with prosecutors.\n\nIt is not clear why he did not tell the truth to investigators. But it is illegal for a private US citizen, as Mr Flynn was during the transition, to conduct foreign affairs without the permission or involvement of the US government.\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, Michael Flynn is accused of:\n\nfalsely telling FBI agents that on or about 29 December 2016 he did not ask Mr Kislyak to \"refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day\"\n\nfailing to recall that Mr Kislyak had later told him Russia was moderating its response to the sanctions as a result of his request\n\nfalsely saying that, on or about 22 December 2016, he did not ask Mr Kislyak to \"delay the vote on or defeat a pending United Nations Security Council resolution\". The discussion came a day before the Obama administration decided not to veto a resolution asserting that Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territory \"had no legal validity\"\n\nmaking false statements about the Turkish government's involvement and supervision of a project that his intelligence company was taking part in.\n\nMr Flynn is not the first former Trump official to be charged.\n\nIn October, Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his business associate Rick Gates were accused of conspiring to defraud the US in dealings with Ukraine (both deny the charges). Another ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, has also pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents\n\nHow damaging is this for President Trump?\n\nBy Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America reporter\n\nMichael Flynn lost his prized national security adviser post because of December 2016 conversations he had with Sergei Kislyak. Now he's facing criminal charges.\n\nThat's bad news for Mr Flynn, but it could be even worse news for Donald Trump, who reportedly directly lobbied former FBI Director James Comey to back off the Flynn investigation before firing the top law man.\n\nMr Flynn has told Robert Mueller's team that he spoke with Trump presidential transition officials before and after reaching out to Mr Kislyak, and was instructed on how to handle the call. This contradicts public assertions made by the president himself that Mr Flynn was operating independently and against orders.\n\nIf the former national security adviser has evidence that corroborates his claims, it would be the biggest bombshell yet in this wide-ranging investigation.\n\nIt's clear the special counsel investigation is casting a very wide net, and Mr Mueller just landed his biggest fish yet.\n\nWhat have we learned about Russia?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe\n\nAs part of his plea bargain, Michael Flynn has signed a \"statement of the offence\" that gives us a timeline of the days of presidential transition in late December 2016, before Donald Trump was sworn in on 20 January 2017.\n\nThis is what federal prosecutors allege happened:"}
