{"text": "Hanks made the comments in conversation with James Franco, John Boyega, Gary Oldman, Willem Dafoe and Sam Rockwell\n\nTom Hanks has discussed the current state of the Hollywood movie industry, in the wake of widespread allegations of sexual assault.\n\nSpeaking as part of a Hollywood Reporter Actor Roundtable discussion alongside fellow actors James Franco, John Boyega, Gary Oldman, Willem Dafoe and Sam Rockwell, the Forrest Gump megastar remarked that \u201cit\u2019s never too late to change things\u2026 and that\u2019s the responsibility of anybody who wants to obey a code of professional ethics.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on why he thinks Hollywood is so rife with sexual assault cases, Hanks continued: \u201cThere can be that type of predatory aspect on a set because you think, \u2018Well, we\u2019re in the circus and we\u2019re on the road, so therefore, do the rules really apply? They don\u2019t really apply.\u2019 There\u2019s the other aspect of it is that, \u2018Come try to get this job from me. You want me to give you a job? Come on. Come. Come prove to me that you want this job.\u2019 That\u2019s a sin, and that\u2019s against the law and that is a degree of harassment and predatory behaviour that goes against an assumed code of ethics.\u201d\n\nPreviously as part of THR\u2019s Actress Roundtable, Jennifer Lawrence revealed that standing up for herself on set led her to fear her job was threatened.\n\nShe continued by stating that these incidents are commonplace in Hollywood, and she believes contribute to a culture of harassment and subsequent silence from victims.\n\n\u201cI was called difficult and a nightmare,\u201d she adds. \u201cI think a lot of people aren\u2019t coming forward because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re not going to work again. You need to be able to say, \u2018This is wrong\u2019 and have somebody do something about it instead of saying, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s wrong? Well, you\u2019re fired.\u2019\u201d", "title": "Tom Hanks talks sexual harassment in Hollywood: \"It's never too late to change things\"", "url": "http://www.nme.com/news/film/tom-hanks-talks-sexual-harassment-hollywood-never-late-change-things-2167210"}
