He would not register as a foreign agent until March, a month after he was fired from the White House.\n\nAccording to a document obtained by BuzzFeed News, the Justice Department\u2019s counter-espionage division contacted Flynn about his Turkey work as early as Nov. 30. They also shared their suspicions with White House counsel Don McGahn in January, a former senior Justice official told BuzzFeed News.\n\nIn the court filing released on Friday, Flynn admitted that \u201cofficials from the Republic of Turkey had provided supervision and direction\u201d over his firm's lobbying work, called the \u201cTurkey project\u201d in the document.\n\nWhile Fynn's work for Turkey was overshadowed by his guilty plea for lying to the FBI about contacts with Russian officials, Friday's court filings were the first time the retired Army lieutenant general has acknowledged that a foreign government directed his actions while he served on the Trump campaign. This contradicts previous statements by Ekim Alptekin, the Turkish businessman whose company paid Flynn, and by Turkish officials, who have vehemently denied that Flynn\u2019s lobbying was connected to their government.\n\n\u201cFor the record: nobody remotely linked to the Gov. of Turkey knew about Gen. Flynn's article in advance and I wasn't consulted either,\u201d Alptekin, an Erdogan ally, tweeted on March 8, the day after Flynn registered as a foreign agent."}
