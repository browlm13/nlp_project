{"title": "U.S. Stocks Fall as Flynn Said to Implicate Trump", "text": "Financial markets turned defensive, with U.S. stocks sliding the most in two weeks and Treasuries rallying with gold after Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents. Equities pared the worst of the losses as Senate Republicans edged closer to passing tax cuts.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index fell as much as 1.5 percent before cutting the drop by more than two-thirds. The index remains on track for its best week since mid-September after improving odds for tax reform pushed equities to records Thursday. The 10-year Treasury yield fell five basis points Friday and Bloomberg\u2019s dollar index slid as investors flocked to the yen.\n\nHaven assets surged after the former national security adviser agreed to provide cooperation that promises to take Special Counsel Robert Mueller deep into Donald Trump\u2019s administration, unnerving markets that have been rallying on speculation tax cuts will jump start already strong economic growth. Equities pulled back from their depths amid news that Senate Republicans have the votes to pass tax cuts contributed.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a long time, the political risks are starting to seep into the capital markets,\u201d Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo & Co. \u201cThere is some real possibility that Trump has some issues and the market is pricing in those issues today. That also seeps into taxes. It is somewhat surprising, but markets are also firming a little bit so maybe the initial reaction was a bit stretched.\u201d\n\nEarlier Flynn, who was fired as President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser after revelations that he lied about his communications with Russia\u2019s ambassador, was charged for lying to federal agents about the contact.\n\nThe Flynn news overshadowed the Senate tax bill as it headed for a round of marathon votes Friday, with the chance of passage remaining high even after leaders suspended voting yesterday after a key compromise to win a majority had collapsed. Equities have been rallying on signs the bill will pass, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 24,000 for the first time Thursday.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden we get this news out and kind of have the rug jerked out from underneath the Trump Trade,\u201d Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, said by phone. \u201cI\u2019m going by the seat of my pants based on what I\u2019m hearing but we\u2019ve had this great rally in the market, and now we have this other issue. We\u2019ve had the rug jerked out from underneath us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s shocking, at least not since Flynn cut off communications a couple weeks ago,\u201d Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group LLC, said by phone. \u201cBut as far as the markets, markets don\u2019t like volatility of any kind and this creates the possibility of uncertainty in the White House.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s ahead for markets in the coming days:\n\nOn Monday, Euro-area finance ministers discuss the future of the euro area, vote for a new president, and debate Greece\u2019s bailout review in Brussels.\n\nThe European Commission College of Commissioners discusses Brexit on Wednesday and will likely make its recommendation on whether sufficient progress has been made to move negotiations onto the future relationship.\n\nThe U.S. faces a partial government shutdown after money runs out on Dec. 8 if Congress can\u2019t agree on a spending bill by then.\n\nU.S. employers probably hired at a robust pace in November as the unemployment rate held at an almost 17-year low. The Labor Department\u2019s jobs report next Friday may also show a bump up in average hourly earnings.\n\nCountries setting monetary policy include Australia, Brazil, Canada, India and Poland.\n\nThese are the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent at 2:10 p.m. in New York. It\u2019s higher by 1.4 percent for the week, most since Sept. 15.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index fell 0.6 percent, bringing its five-day slide to 1.3 percent.\n\nThe Russell 2000 Index of small caps fell 0.8 percent Friday.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank 0.7 percent.\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Market Index fell 0.4 percent, falling for the fourth day in five.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2 percent, the first retreat in a week.\n\nThe euro was little changed at $1.1908.\n\nThe Japanese yen gained 0.3 percent to 112.19 per dollar.\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries dipped four basis points to 2.37 percent.\n\nGermany\u2019s 10-year yield decreased three basis points to 0.34 percent, the lowest in more than three weeks on the biggest tumble in five weeks.\n\nBritain\u2019s 10-year yield sank four basis points to 1.33 percent, the largest tumble in more than four weeks.\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude advanced 1.4 percent to $58.23 a barrel, the largest gain in a week.\n\nGold futures jumped 0.8 percent to $1,286.90 an ounce.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Randall Jensen", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/asian-stocks-set-to-rebound-after-u-s-advance-markets-wrap?"}
