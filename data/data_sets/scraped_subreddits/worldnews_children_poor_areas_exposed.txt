In June 2014 the average English school had 2.3 takeaways within 400 metres. By September 2017 it had risen to 2.6.\n\nThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this week highlighted the problem when he published draft planning rules designed to prevent new takeaways opening within 400 metres of schools in the capital, part of a package of measures he said would \u201ctackle the ticking timebomb of childhood obesity and help us all lead healthier lives\u201d.\n\n\n\nBut the Cedar figures show that the areas around schools in many parts of London are already saturated with fast food outlets. Of the 20 English local authorities with the highest average number of takeaways near schools, 17 are in the capital.\n\nSchools in London have an average of six fast food outlets within a 400-metre vicinity, although this rises to more than eight in the poorest areas and falls to fewer than two in the wealthiest.\n\n\n\nAccording to Public Health England (PHE), a third of children aged two to 15 are obese or overweight. In London, 40% of children are overweight or obese when they finish primary school, the highest proportion in England.\n\nBefore the mayor of London\u2019s announcement, only about 20 local authorities in England had adopted planning regulations designed to limit the number of fast food outlets. While some have succeeded in capping numbers, there is no clear evidence it has delivered public health dividends.\n\nSeven of the 10 schools with the highest density of nearby fast food outlets are in London. At the top of the scale is the Soho Parish primary school in the heart of the West End, which has 94 fast food restaurants within a 400-metre radius, up from 82 in 2014, a rise of 15%.\n\n\n\nOutside the capital, schools surrounded by dense clusters of fast food outlets include Middle Street primary in Brighton, which has 67 outlets within a 400-metre radius, St Anne\u2019s in Blackburn, with 46, Hope House in Barnsley (42), and Grafton House in Tameside (42).\n\nMartin Caraher, a professor of food policy at City, University of London, welcomed the mayor\u2019s plans, but warned that they may be undermined by cuts to local council public health budgets. \u201cAll credit to Sadiq Khan, this is a brave move,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it comes with a cost, and council public health budgets have been squeezed and staff are leaving. Who is going to monitor and implement this plan?\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s draft plan, which came into force on Wednesday, bans new takeaways within a 400-metre walking distance of a primary or secondary school. There are no powers to operate planning rules retrospectively, meaning the measure will stop additional outlets opening but will not close existing ones.\n\nIt also requires new takeaways to sign up to a healthier catering commitment, which encourages owners to make simple changes to food preparation methods, such as grilling rather than deep frying, and using less salt.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Soho Parish primary in central London has 94 fast food outlets within a 400-metre radius, according to Cedar.

This does not include chains such as McDonald\u2019s, which operate as restaurants with takeaway capacity and are classified differently.\n\nNor does it include operators such as Greggs bakeries whose primary business is not as a hot food takeaway. The Cedar figures do include such shops as well as McDonald\u2019s-style outlets.\n\nA Guardian investigation in July revealed that the fast food retail industry was booming. Cedar analysis found that there were 56,600 hot food takeaways in England in 2017, an 8% increase in three years. The heaviest concentrations of fast food outlets were to be found in the most economically deprived areas, such as the north-west.\n\nFast food nation: do more takeaways near schools affect younger pupils' diets? Read more\n\nPHE called this year for all councils to introduce planning restrictions on fast food into their local planning schemes. Currently, about 20 local authorities in England have implemented planning strategies to limit takeaway numbers. While some claim the new rules have kept a lid on overall A5 outlet numbers, it is not clear if any of the councils have managed to stop the rise of obesity.\n\nExperts have warned that planning restrictions may be of limited use, partly because they do not stop the expansion of other shops selling high fat, low nutrient food, such as supermarkets or newsagents.\n\nThe restrictions may also be bypassed by developments in the hospitality industry such as the rise of online ordering of fast food, often prepared in \u201cdark kitchens\u201d off the high street not covered by A5 class planning rules.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/dec/01/schoolchildren-poor-areas-exposed-fast-food-takeaways"}
