Mr Flynn said that in December 2016 - as Mr Trump was preparing to take office - he was instructed to contact Russia\u2019s Washington Ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak, taking direction from a \"very senior member\" of the transition team. He also said that he had discussed what to say to Mr Kislyak with other \"senior members\" of the team.\n\nWhile the official was not named in court documents, multiple reports suggest that Jared Kusher, a senior White House adviser and Mr Trump's son-in-law, could be the \"very senior official\" involved in conversations.\n\nMr Flynn, a former army general, admitted that during telephone conversations with Mr Kislyak, he asked for Russia to try and delay a UN resolution criticising Israeli settlements and not to respond in kind to the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats by Barack Obama in response to Moscow\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election. A day after the second request to Mr Kislyak, Vladimir Putin announced he was not going to expel US diplomats, a move that was subsequently praised by Mr Trump.\n\nThe questions we need answered now:\n\n1) What does @realDonaldTrump know about Russian meddling?\n\n2) Why does he still refuse to take action against Russia? \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) December 1, 2017\n\nMr Flynn, 58, appeared in court in Washington. He cut a businesslike figure in a dark suit, offering only perfunctory answers to questions from Judge Rudolph Contreras. Mr Flynn acknowledged the government\u2019s summary of the charge to which he was pleading guilty was correct. He also said that he understood all possible consequences of his plea agreement and that his sentence could end up being either more, or less than the sentencing guidelines permit. He charge brings a potential sentence of up to five years in prison.\n\nAfter the hearing Mr Flynn issued a statement in which spoke of the pain of enduring allegations of treason - accusations he denied.\n\nYet he added: \u201cI recognise that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump's lawyers also moved quickly to assign blame to the former national security adviser. They said he had been fired as soon as it became clear that he had lied about his contacts with Mr Kislyak.\n\n\u201cNothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn,\u201d said Ty Cobb, the President\u2019s lawyer leading the team dealing with the Russia inquiry.\n\nMr Flynn pleaded guilty to one charge of lying to investigators when he appeared in court (AP)\n\nCourt documents show that Mr Flynn told investigators that on December 29, he called \"a senior transition official\", who was with other members of the team at Mr Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida \u201cto discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian ambassador about the US sanctions\u201d.\n\nThe documents say that on December 22 2016, a \"very senior member\" of the team contacted him and asked him to speak with the Russian envoy about the UN vote on Israel as well as a number of other countries. Mr Kusher has been handed the task of helping to achieve a peace deal between the Israeli's and the Palestinians.\n\nIt is understood Mr Kushner was in Hawaii on December 29 2016. It is believed he was one of several senior officials within the Trump transition team working to avoid the UN criticism of Israel.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he would wish to interview Mr Kushner again, with Mr Kushner having previously testified in camera.\n\n\u201cThere are a number, like Mr Kushner and others, that we\u2019re going to want to invite back,\u201d said Mr Warner told reporters. He declined to say whether that would include Vice President Mike Pence, who was also among the senior figures within Mr Trump\u2019s transition team.\n\nThe biggest names involved in the Trump-Russia investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 show all The biggest names involved in the Trump-Russia investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/17 Paul Manafort Mr Manafort is a Republican strategist and former Trump campaign manager.

Mr Papadopoulos plead guilty to federal charges for lying to the FBI as a part of a cooperation agreement with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Mr Papadopoulos claimed in an interview with the FBI that he had made contacts with Russian sources before joining the Trump campaign, but he actually began working with them after joining the team. Mr Papadopoulos allegedly took a meeting with a professor in London who reportedly told him that Russians had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. The professor also allegedly introduced Mr Papadopoulos to a Russian who was said to have close ties to officials at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr Papadopoulos also allegedly was in contact with a woman whom he incorrectly described in one email to others in the campaign as the \"niece\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Twitter\n\n4/17 Donald Trump Jr The President's eldest son met with a Russian lawyer - Natalia Veselnitskaya - on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York. He said in an initial statement that the meeting was about Russia halting adoptions of its children by US citizens. Then, he said it was regarding the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. In a final statement, Mr Trump Jr released a chain of emails that revealed he took the meeting in hopes of getting information Ms Veselnitskaya had about Hillary Clinton's alleged financial ties to Russia. He and the President called it standard \"opposition research\" in the course of campaigning and that no information came from the meeting. The meeting was set up by an intermediary, Rob Goldstone. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort were also at the same meeting. Getty Images\n\n5/17 Jared Kushner Mr Kushner is President Donald Trump's son-in-law and a key adviser to the White House.

Ms Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort in Trump Tower on 9 June 2016 but denies the allegation that she went there promising information on Hillary Clinton's alleged financial ties to Russia. She contends that the meeting was about the US adoptions of Russian children being stopped by Moscow as a reaction to the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers.

Mr Bahara had been heading up several investigations including one into one of President Donald Trump's favorite cable television channels Fox News. Several investigations would lead back to that district, too, including those into Mr Trump's campaign ties to Russia, and Mr Trump's assertion that Trump Tower was wiretapped on orders from his predecessor.

She had also warned the White House about potential ties former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to Russia after discovering those ties during the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign's connections to Russia. Getty Images\n\nDemocrats and other critics of Mr Trump were quick to leap on the developments.\n\n\u201cThe guilty plea of President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russian authorities marks a dark moment in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House.\n\nMr Flynn was the fourth person connected to the Trump campaign to be charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In October, Mr Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his associate Rick Gates, were charged with 12 counts of financial crimes related to their work in Ukraine. At the same time, Mr Mueller revealed foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia-linked individuals - a similar charge that Mr Flynn admitted to as part of the plea deal.\n\nFormer US national security adviser Michael Flynn arrives at court\n\nMr Trump and his lawyers are likely to be intensely concerned that someone who was a key figure within the campaign, was now cooperating with the federal probe.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Flynn was charged with, and is pleading guilty to, such a minor crime, suggests a bombshell of a deal with prosecutors,\u201d said Jens Ohlin, a professor of law at Cornell Law School.\n\n\u201cFlynn was facing serious criminal liability for a variety of alleged missteps, including his failure to register as an agent of a foreign power.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf this is the entirety of the plea deal, the best explanation for why Mueller would agree to it is that Flynn has something very valuable to offer in exchange: damaging testimony on someone else. Who? That\u2019s not clear, but it probably is someone at the centre, or close to the centre, of this criminal enterprise.\u201d\n\nMr Trump has yet to publicly comment on developments. He ignored questions as he welcomed the Libyan prime minister to the White House on Friday afternoon and officials cancelled a press event the two leaders were due to hold.\n\nBoth Mr Warner and Congressman Adam Schiff of California, another Democrat, issued statements saying it would be unacceptable for Mr Trump to try to influence any investigations, including the probes their committees are conducting.\n\nMr Warner referred to an \u201calarming pattern\u201d by Mr Trump, including the president's firing of former FBI Director James Comey, who originally led the Russia investigation, in May. Mr Schiff speculated that Mr Flynn's plea may prompt the White House and its allies to try to curtail congressional investigations or try to end Mueller's probe prematurely. Mr Schiff said that the US Congress \u201cmust make clear\u201d that would be unacceptable."}
