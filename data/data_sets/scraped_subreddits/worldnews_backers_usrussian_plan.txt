That company, major engineering and construction firm OMZ OAO, declined to comment.\n\nThe documents do not show whether Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, took concrete steps to push the proposal with Trump and his aides. But they do show that Washington-based nuclear power consultancy ACU Strategic Partners believed that both Flynn, who had worked as an adviser to the firm as late as mid-2016, and Trump were firmly in its corner.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s election as president is a game changer because Trump\u2019s highest foreign policy priority is to stabilize U.S. relations with Russia which are now at a historical low-point,\u201d ACU\u2019s managing director, Alex Copson, wrote in a Nov. 16, 2016 email to potential business partners, eight days after the election.\n\nWhite House officials did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. ACU declined comment and also declined to make Copson available for an interview. Previously they told a congressional committee that they had not had any dealings with Flynn since May 2016, before Trump became the Republican Party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nFlynn\u2019s lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about a discussion with the former Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak, in late December 2016 regarding sanctions.\n\nThe documents also show that ACU proposed ending Ukraine\u2019s opposition to lifting sanctions on Russia by giving a Ukrainian company a $45 billion contract to provide turbine generators for reactors to be built in Saudi Arabia and other Mideast nations.\n\nThe contract to state-owned Turboatom, and loans to Ukraine from Gulf Arab states, would \u201crequire Ukraine to support lifting US and EU sanctions on Russia,\u201d Copson wrote in the Nov. 16 email.\n\nA Turboatom spokeswoman said she did not have an immediate comment on the matter.\n\nThe email was titled \u201cTRUMP/PUTIN ME Marshall plan CONCEPT.\u201d ME stands for Middle East. The title, evoking the post-World War Two plan to rebuild Western European economies, reflected the hopes of the plan\u2019s backers that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could cooperate on a project that would boost Middle East economies.\n\nThe email can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2ALdoCY\n\nThe ACU documents reviewed by Reuters include emails, business presentations and financial estimates and date from late autumn 2016.\n\n\u2018READY TO GO\u2019\n\nAs part of their investigation into the Trump election campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, Special Counsel Robert Mueller and Democrats on the House of Representatives\u2019 Oversight Committee are probing whether Flynn promoted the Middle East nuclear power project as national security adviser in Trump\u2019s White House.\n\nFlynn resigned after just 24 days as national security adviser after it became known he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence by telling him he had not discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak in late December.\n\nIn response to questions about the emails and documents, ACU referred Reuters to letters written in June and September by ACU scientist Thomas Cochran to the House Oversight Committee.\n\nIn those letters, Cochran had laid out the project\u2019s strategy, describing a \u201cready-to-go\u201d consortium that included French, Russian, Israeli and Ukrainian interests, without naming specific companies.\n\nFormer U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn arrives for a plea hearing at U.S. District Court, where he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States, in Washington, U.S., December 1, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, said the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Trey Gowdy, has for months rejected Democrats\u2019 requests to ask the White House for documents pertaining to the ACU proposal.\n\nGowdy \u201chas blocked all efforts to allow committee members to vote on issuing subpoenas,\u201d Cummings told Reuters.\n\nGowdy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe ACU\u2019s nuclear reactor plan aimed to provide Washington\u2018s Middle East allies with nuclear power in a way that didn\u2019t risk nuclear weapons proliferation and also helped counter Iranian influence, improve dismal U.S.-Russian relations, and revive the moribund U.S. nuclear industry, according to the documents seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post reported this week that Flynn pushed a version of the nuclear project within the White House by instructing his staff to rework a memo written by a former business associate into policy for Trump to sign.\n\nTwo U.S. officials familiar with the issue told Reuters the policy document Flynn prepared for Trump\u2019s approval proposed working with Russia on a nuclear reactor project but did not specifically mention ACU. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did not know if Trump had read the memo or acted upon it.\n\n\u2018THIS IS A BIG WIN\u2019\n\nOn Nov. 18, 2016, 10 days after Trump won the presidential election, ACU\u2019s Copson received an email from nuclear non-proliferation expert Reuben Sorensen saying that he had updated Flynn on the nuclear project\u2019s status. Sorensen\u2019s role in the project was not clear from the emails.\n\n\u201cFlynn is getting closer to (being named) National Security Advisor. Expect an announcement soon. This is a big win for the ACU project,\u201d Sorensen wrote.\n\n\u201cSpoke with him via backchannels earlier this week. He has always believed in the vision of the ACU effort ... We need to let him get settled into the new position, but update him shortly thereafter,\u201d Sorensen added.\n\nThe email can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2zTqxcZ\n\nReuters could not independently confirm a briefing took place. Sorensen did not reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nOn Nov. 30, 2016, Copson briefed U.S. Representative Ed Royce, Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on the nuclear project, an email shows.\n\nCopson was joined by Jim Hamel, a senior official from Curtiss-Wright Corp., which has a nuclear division based in Royce\u2019s California district and was eager for a role in the multi-billion dollar project.\n\nIn a follow-up email on Dec. 5 to a Royce aide, Hamel wrote, \u201cWe hope that the Chairman will follow-up on Alex\u2019s suggestion to reach out to General Flynn\u201d to discuss the project.\n\nRoyce\u2019s spokesman, Cory Fritz, confirmed the briefing to Reuters. \u201cNo action was ever taken by the chairman or the committee,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nHamel and Curtiss-Wright declined to comment.\n\nFlynn was an adviser to ACU from April 2015 to June 2016, according to amended financial disclosure forms he filed in August 2017 to the Office of Government Ethics.\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee say that when Flynn applied last year to renew his government security clearance, he failed to disclose a June 2015 trip he made to Egypt and Israel to promote the reactor project. Flynn has not commented on the trips."}
