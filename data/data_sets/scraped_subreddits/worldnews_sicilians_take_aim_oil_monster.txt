A 2011 study by the Italian health service drew a similar conclusion: dozens of babies were dying in the womb or within a week of being born every year from complications caused by environmental contamination.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The refinery in Gela.

Contacted by the Guardian, Eni said it was \u201cwaiting for the decision of the judge\u201d and that it trusted the work of its managers in Gela.\n\nEni said there was no evidence that malformations were caused by emissions from its refinery rather than other factors such as smog or other substances present in the air.\n\nIn 2007, Fontanella asked the local court to investigate the correlation between the high rate of birth defects and pollution from the refinery, which residents nicknamed \u201cthe Monster of Gela\u201d.\n\nThe court accepted his proposal in 2012 and commissioned environmentalists, doctors and geneticists to study the links.\n\nThe experts\u2019 study concluded in 2015 that the sea around Gela was so polluted that it was \u201ctechnically incorrect to talk about the toxic contamination of the water\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe toxic contaminant should be less than, in this case, the water,\u201d they wrote. \u201cGela seems to be the opposite: it is the water that is the contaminant of the toxic substance.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gela\u2019s chief prosecutor, Fernando Asaro, who has led the investigation. Photograph: Francesco Bellina for the Guardian\n\nThe alleged victims include 20-year-old Kimberly Scudera, who has spina bifida \u2013 a severe condition where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly in the womb \u2013 and uses a wheelchair.\n\nThe court-commissioned doctors said of her condition: \u201cThe technical commission unanimously believes that the possibility that Kimberly Scudera\u2019s spina bifida has been caused by the presence of chemicals in the environment (air, water, nutrition), produced by the industrial plant, is entirely concrete.\u201d\n\nScudera is an Italian archery champion training to participate in the 2020 Paralympics. Her family has sought \u2013 but not received \u2013 payment from Eni for her care. She lives in an apartment on the second floor of the family home. Her family does not have the money to build a lift. To take her to training each day, Scudera\u2019s mother carries her down the stairs on her back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s considered almost ordinary here, something we\u2019re all used to,\u201d Scudera said. \u201cOf course I feel angry.\u201d\n\nEni said the study \u201chasn\u2019t reached appreciable results\u2019\u2019 and \u201cin this context, no reparations is being considered\u201d.\n\nEni reached the same conclusion about Nicol\u00f2 Pace, 15, who was born with a severe cleft palate. In order to pay for Nicol\u00f2\u2019s care, his father, Antonio, has accumulated heavy debts.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Antonio said. \u201cIf we\u2019ll ever get a reparation cheque, the money will all go to my son, for his future, so that he can begin doing what he wants in life, after years of suffering.\u201d\n\nIn March, Fontanella asked the local court to seize the farmland around the refinery, to prevent people from eating products linked to the birth defects. Fontanella also asked for \u20ac20m (\u00a318m) in compensation for 100 of the affected families.\n\nThe court has not yet commented on these requests.\n\nGela\u2019s chief prosecutor, Fernando Asaro, who has led the investigation alongside the local branch of the Italian coastguard, said: \u201cOn the one hand, the petrochemical plant has provided work for a large number of families here. On the other, its presence has heavily polluted the air, water and subsoil of the area, causing tumours and genetic malformations among the population. It was our duty, especially with regard to these people, to intervene.\u201d\n\nAs early as 1998, the Italian state \u2013 which holds a stake in Eni \u2013 recognised the potential link between the refinery and the town\u2019s health problems. That year, the environment ministry included Gela on a list of highly contaminated areas. The government recommended that Eni carry out what it called remediation works \u2013 to decontaminate the area \u2013 with an estimated cost of \u20ac127m. The works were never completed.\n\nFontanella said the fight for justice was far from over. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a lawyer in this trial. I feel more like a captain of a ship, sailing in a stormy sea. And I will fight those waves until the end, until my clients receive what Eni has taken away from them.\u201d"}
