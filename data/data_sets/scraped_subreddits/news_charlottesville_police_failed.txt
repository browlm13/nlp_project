{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The law enforcement response to the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer was marred by a series of major failures that put citizens\u2019 lives at risk, according to an extensive new review.\n\nThe findings of former U.S. Attorney Tim Heaphy\u2019s monthslong investigation were unveiled Friday. City officials asked him to conduct the review after facing scathing criticism over the Aug. 12 rally.\n\nSeveral people were injured in the melee surrounding the rally, and 32-year-old Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.\n\n\u201cI talked to no police officers from the chief on down who feels good about what happened or wanted there to be violence in the streets,\u201d Heaphy said in a news conference unveiling the 220-page report. \u201cThere were a lot of well-intentioned people, ethical people, who feel bad about this. Nonetheless, they didn\u2019t protect public safety.\u201d\n\nThe blistering report criticizes police planning as \u201cinadequate and disconnected.\u201d Charlottesville police supervisors failed to provide adequate training to line officers and police planners waited too long to request assistance from state emergency response officials, the report said.\n\nIn another blunder, city and state police failed to properly coordinate before Aug. 12 and were unable to communicate that day by radio because their respective systems were not connected, the report found.\n\n\u201cThe planning and coordination breakdowns \u2026 produced disastrous results,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe report revealed that a school resource officer, posted in the area where the car plowed into counterprotesters, had been removed over concerns about safety and not replaced.\n\nThe officer had been stationed at the intersection of 4th Street and Market Street earlier in the day. But when the officer called for backup amid a stream of angry alt-right protesters and counter-protesters, she was relieved of her post, the report found.\n\n\u201cA single wooden saw horse was all that impeded traffic down 4th Street as large groups of people continued to roam the streets,\u201d the report stated.\n\nJust over an hour later, a 20-year-old Ohio man, James Fields, allegedly sped past that barrier, crashing into the crowd of counterprotesters, killing Heyer. Woods has been charged with second-degree murder in Heyer\u2019s death.\n\nHeaphy said Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas took a \u201cmisguidedly passive\u201d approach to quelling the violence that erupted on Charlottesville streets both before and after police declared the \u201cUnited the Right\u201d rally at Emancipation Park unlawful and ordered the crowds dispersed.\n\nAs the first signs of open violence broke out on Charlottesville\u2019s Market Street, the police chief reportedly said, \u201cLet them fight, it will make it easier to declare an unlawful assembly,'\u201d according to the report.\n\nThomas said he does not recall making that statement.\n\n\u201cRegardless of what he said, Chief Thomas\u2019 slow-footed response to violence put the safety of all at risk and created indelible images of this chaotic event,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nOverall, the report said law enforcement\u2019s passive approach amounted to a \u201ctremendous tactical failure.\u201d\n\nAs clashes between so-called \u201calt-right\u201d protesters and counter-protesters broke out, police were directed to stay behind barricades or were too far away to intervene, leading to a \u201cperiod of lawlessness and tension that threatened the safety of the entire community,\u201d the report stated.\n\nOfficers with both the Charlottesville Police Department and Virginia State Police were generally directed to remain behind barricades rather than risk injury responding to physical altercations between protesters and counterprotesters, in part because officers were inadequately equipped, the report found.\n\n\u201cWhen violence was most prevalent, CPD commanders pulled officers back to a protected area of the park, where they remained for over an hour as people in the large crowd fought on Market Street,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe review also casts blame on Charlottesville City Council members who, just days before the rally was set to take place, sought to move it from downtown Emancipation Park to the much larger McIntire Park.\n\nThe last-minute changes hamstrung police planning, led to confusion about the rally\u2019s location and frustrated members of the public, the report said.\n\nCharlottesville City Manager Maruice Jones responded to the report in a statement.\n\n\u201cAlthough we do not agree with every aspect of the report\u2019s findings we do appreciate the efforts of the reviewers to talk to people from all walks of life about their experiences from this summer,\u201d Jones said.\n\nJones acknowledged that city officials and law enforcement \u201cundoubtedly fell short of expectations, and for that we are profoundly sorry.\u201d He called Heaphy\u2019s report a \u201ccritical step in helping this community heal and move forward after suffering through this summer of hate.\u201d\n\nJones said city officials are developing an action plan that will be unveiled next week to lay out a series of new policies in the wake of the report.\n\nThe Associated Press and WTOP\u2019s Neal Augenstein contributed to this report.", "title": "Charlottesville police failed to protect citizens at white nationalist rally, report finds", "url": "https://wtop.com/virginia/2017/12/report-coming-on-charlottesville-white-nationalist-rally/"}
