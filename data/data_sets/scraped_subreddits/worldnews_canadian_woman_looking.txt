I\u2019ve never encountered that before.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel emotionally uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nDisturbed by the image, Leatherbarrow is hoping for a city bylaw that that would prevent graphic images like the one she and her children saw two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI think they are doing more harm than good,\u201d she said. \u201cMy three year old was really confused; I don\u2019t know how to explain abortion to a three-year-old.\u201d\n\nLeatherbarrow said she is not targeting specific organizations.\n\n\u201cIf it was PETA, (the bylaw) would apply to them too,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not against freedom of speech. I don\u2019t mind them protesting but there has to be a way to educate without these gory images. They need to do it in a way that the community is not traumatized by these images.\u201d\n\nBut a strong, emotional response to the graphic images is exactly what organizations that utilize them are hoping for.\n\nThe pro-life organization identified by Leatherbarrow were using materials designed by the Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform (CCBR.)\n\n\u201cThe history of social reform indicates that using visual evidence of an injustice is the most effective way of changing minds,\u201d explained Devorah Gilman of CCBR.\n\nThe organization provides images, like the one Leatherbarrow complained about, to make their point about abortion.\n\n\u201cWe have commissioned independent pollsters to test our results, and found that abortion-victim photography dramatically changes the way people think about abortion, and we have been privileged to see many women cancel their abortions,\u201d Gilman said. \u201cWhen we see a picture that shows the broken bloody body of a human, being disturbed is an appropriate response. We have a responsibility to be a voice for these voiceless children.\"\n\nGilman also said the organization is \u201cprepared to challenge any restriction of our freedom of expression in court.\u201d\n\nOn December 2, Leatherbarrow said she will be taking her petition to the Woodstock Farmers\u2019 Market.\n\nAnd on Dec. 14, she is meeting with Mayor Trevor Birtch and will address city council later in the day.\n\nHRivers@postmedia.com"}
