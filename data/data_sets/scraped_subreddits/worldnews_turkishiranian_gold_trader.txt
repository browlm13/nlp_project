At the time of the alleged conspiracy, Erdogan was Turkey\u2019s prime minister.\n\nZarrab said he had learned from Zafer Caglayan, who was Turkey\u2019s economy minister, that Erdogan and then-treasury minister Ali Babacan had authorized two Turkish banks, Ziraat Bank and VakifBank, to move funds for Iran.\n\nBoth Ziraat and VakifBank denied taking part in the scheme.\n\nErdogan\u2019s spokesman, and an adviser to Babacan could not immediately be contacted by Reuters. Erdogan said earlier on Thursday that Turkey did not violate U.S. sanctions, CNN Turk reported. A spokesman for Erdogan\u2019s government has called the case a \u201cplot against Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe testimony came on the third day of the trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey\u2019s state-owned Halkbank, who has pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court.\n\nU.S. prosecutors have charged nine people in the case with conspiring to help Iran evade sanctions, although only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, have been arrested by U.S. authorities.\n\nTurkish gold trader Reza Zarrab is shown in this court room sketch as he appears in Manhattan federal court in New York, U.S., April 24, 2017.

On Thursday, he said that he had to stop the gold trades and start moving money through fake food purchases instead in 2013, after U.S. sanctions changed.\n\nZarrab has said that Atilla helped design the gold transactions, along with Halkbank\u2019s former general manager, Suleyman Aslan.\n\nOn Thursday, Zarrab discussed a 2013 phone call with Atilla about his plan to switch from gold trades to fake food sales. He said Atilla did not understand at the time that no actual food would be sent to Iran, and was reluctant to sign off on the plan.\n\nZarrab said Aslan ordered Atilla to allow the transaction.\n\nZarrab has testified that in the course of his scheme, he bribed Aslan and former Turkish economy minister Zafer Caglayan.\n\nBoth Caglayan and Aslan were charged in the case. Reuters was not able to reach Caglayan or Aslan for comment.\n\nTurkey\u2019s government has previously said that Caglayan acted lawfully, and Halkbank has said it acted lawfully as well. Caglayan previously said that similar allegations in a 2013 corruption investigation in Turkey that was later dismissed were \u201cunfounded claims\u201d.", "title": "A Turkish-Iranian gold trader on Thursday told jurors in a New York federal court that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan personally authorized a transaction in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-zarrab/turkish-gold-trader-implicates-erdogan-in-iran-money-laundering-idUSKBN1DU23B?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews"}
