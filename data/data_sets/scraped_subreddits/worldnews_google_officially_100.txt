The company signed contracts on three wind power plants in recent days to bring them over 3GW of production capacity.\n\nGoogle\u2019s energy infrastructure investments have totaled over $3.5 billion globally, with about two-thirds being in the US.\n\nPer an announcement made via Twitter and the LinkedIn page of Sam Arons, Google\u2019s Senior Lead, Energy & Infrastructure at Google:\n\n535 MW more wind brings Google over 3 GW worldwide \u2014 2*98 MW with Avangrid in South Dakota, 200 MW with EDF in Iowa, and 138.6 MW with GRDA in Oklahoma \u2014 cementing Google as the largest corporate purchaser of renewables on the planet @ 100% renewable in 2017!\n\nCiting a cost decrease of 60%-80% in wind and solar as the driving factor, Google has been investing heavily in renewables. They first signed an agreement in 2010 to purchase all of the production per year from a 114MW wind farm in Iowa. As of November of 2016, they\u2019d participated in 20 renewable energy projects. The company announced that they\u2019d break 100% renewable back in December of 2016.\n\nGoogle is the world\u2019s largest corporate buyer or renewable energy, totaling over 3.0GW. This is nearly twice as much as the next largest purchaser of renewables, Amazon, at about 1.5GW. Jeff Bezos showed off on one of his recent wind power installations.\n\nThe Twitter announcement offered no details \u2013 but gave a nice calming GIF:\n\nNew clean energy purchases bring our total wind and solar capacity to over 3 gigawatts\u2014enough renewables to match 100% of the energy it takes to run our products in 2017. pic.twitter.com/8ykaWO9LU0 \u2014 Google (@Google) November 30, 2017\n\nAvangrid Renewables was one of the developers that signed with Google. They\u2019re building two 98MW wind farms in South Dakota. Avangrid suggested the two farms would contribute more than $40 million in land leases and tax payments over their lifetimes.\n\nRegarding the South Dakota plants \u2013\n\n\u201cRenewables from projects like Coyote Ridge and Tatanka Ridge bring value to our business as we scale and accelerate investment in the communities where we operate,\u201d Gary Demasi, Google\u2019s director of global infrastructure, said in a statement. \u201cWith solar and wind declining dramatically in cost and propelling significant employment growth, the transition to clean energy is driving unprecedented economic opportunity and doing so faster than we ever anticipated.\u201d\n\nEDF signed a 200MW deal for a project in the Glaciers Edge Wind Project in Iowa. This project will come online in 2019.\n\nInterestingly, just yesterday it was reported that Google shut down the lead source portion of Project Sunroof. It was suggested that Google\u2019s logic for cancelling the program \u2013 even with an overflow of companies around the country asking for access for the leads \u2013 was that they thought selling leads for solar power was not their main skill set, but \u2013 obviously \u2013 selling ads is. The company now redirects Project Sunroof users to solar companies in Google\u2019s main search directory.\n\nGoogle Environmental Report is located here \u2013 with updates in 2017.\n\nConsidering residential solar?
